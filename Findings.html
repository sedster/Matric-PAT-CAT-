	<tr>
	<td>It has been shown that approximately half of the respondents get access to advertisements online, when watching videos on YouTube, or listening to music through streaming services e.g. Spotify.
	<td>The survey has provided a clear indication that advertisements are a part of the youth’s daily lives, with nearly three quarters of the respondents viewing them several times a day. </td>
	<td>Ads – as often as they appear on your screen – are considered as annoying. Especially if they are displaying a product that you may not want, dislike or cannot afford.</td>
	<td>Since the commencement of the lockdown, there was a large demand for the items that were out of access due to laws that were placed at the time. </td>
	<td>Ads (as useful as they can be) have only proven to be effective to well-known stores selling items of necessity during the hard lockdown. </td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	<td>This indicates that the majority of people have instant access to the internet. </td>
	<td>This is because the internet and social media have become items of necessity during the lockdown period, with an increase in usage when citizens are confined to their homes and have nothing to do.</td>
	<td>The survey shows that only 28% of the respondents view advertisements and consider buying the products shown.</td>
	<td>People gradually started making use of online features or services to buy the products that they needed or wanted, instead of travelling to the store and possibly contracting the virus unknowingly.</td>
	<td>This was because other stores were forced to remain closed during this period.</td>

	</tr>
	
	<tr>
	<td>. A large number of respondents also view ads on television, as it remains a declining - but largely used - device amongst society.</td>
	<td bgcolor="black"></td>
	<td>The rest of the respondents close the ads as quickly as it appeared on their screens.</td>
	<td bgcolor="black"></td>
	<td>Small businesses were also temporarily unable to run, but were soon after reintroduced because there was a serious deprivation of a source of income for the owners of these small businesses.</td>
