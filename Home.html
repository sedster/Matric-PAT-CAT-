<h3>The Focus Question of this investigation is:	</h3>
How is ICT providing significant improvements to the trading sector on an international scale? 
</p>

<h2> Introduction</h2>
COVID-19 has brought a drastic change into our everyday lives. Businesses were forced to shut down as a technique to improve health facilities and people were not allowed to leave their places of residence. This had a great impact on the trading sector, but it also gave an opportunity for technology to make advancements where possible.
Today, information and communications technology is among the most rapidly growing sectors in world trade (von Unger, 2019). Trade in ICT products accounts for roughly one-eighth of the global merchandise imports and exports.
The trading sector revolves mainly around marketing, and its main aspect is advertising because the main purpose is to attract customers and evoke a desire within them for the product or service that is advertised. Technology has simplified this process by making goods and most services available online, which limits the number of occasions in which an individual has to leave their place of residence. People may have items such as food, clothes and accessories delivered to them in order to avoid contact with others, thus minimizing the level of risk that an individual has of contracting the Coronavirus pandemic.
When the hard lockdown commenced in South Africa March 27, 2020, it brought change into the system of buying goods. Several stores were inaccessible while health facilities were being upgraded with adequate ventilation and oxygen supply to support COVID-19 patients. Simultaneously, entrepreneurs took this as an opportunity to create a virtual presence for their products and services, in order to sustain the profitability of their businesses and ensure the safety of the customers by buying their products remotely. This meant that advertisements needed to be shifted more towards the places that people under lockdown would be, places with a larger target audience under the above-mentioned circumstances, such as the internet and television, not outdoor settings like billboards.

<h2>  Issue</h2>
In an global health crisis that was not anticipated or thoroughly prepared for in advance, trade is essential to save lives and livelihoods; and international co-operation is needed to keep trade flowing. In the midst of significant uncertainty, there are four things that can be done:

<ul type = 'circle'>
<li>Boost confidence in trade and global markets by improving transparency about trade-related policy actions and intentions</li>
<li>Keep supply chains flowing, especially for essentials such as health supplies and food</li>
<li>Avoid making things worse, through unnecessary export restrictions and other trade barriers</li>
<li>Even in the midst of the crisis, think beyond the immediate.<br/>Government support today needs to be delivered in a way that ensures it serves the public interest, not vested interests,<br/>and avoids becoming tomorrow’s market distortions.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
