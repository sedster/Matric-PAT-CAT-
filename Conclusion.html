<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>
	In times of crisis and its aftermath, successful companies reinvented themselves by placing data and artificial intelligence at the core of their organizations. '' You can use artificial intelligence and analytics in two ways:</br> 
	As new challenges, opportunities, and use cases emerge, driven by your inherent needs driven by systemic changes in consumer behavior under the "new reality". </br>
	Key areas where artificial intelligence and analytics will play a key role (driven by internal demand):</br></br>
	<ul type = "square">
	<li>Revenue planning and business continuity-some of which may be temporary due to the pandemic and the large-scale shift to telecommuting. Most will continue to exist because it will always allow more organizations to prepare for long-term data-driven strategies that can create scenario-based analysis by using key variables while dynamically updating the model when new data becomes available. This will be helping to solve the problem – uncertainty - effectively.</li>
	<li>Network and operation analysis: AI/ML-based analysis can provide automatic anomaly detection of any scale. As traffic increases and network outages increase, understanding spikes and outages in an automated and scalable way becomes critical.</li>
	<li>Artificial intelligence collaboration services: The voice and video calls of communication and collaboration platforms have grown exponentially. Voice AI enables video conference users to start, join, or end meetings.</li>
	<li>Digitization and automation: The current crisis is a huge accelerator of digitization for both consumers and companies, and even the most skeptical will be ready to integrate the digital agenda into their organizations and actively promote the automation of their processes.</li>
	<li>Advanced data management and integration. As Cloud services continue to grow and the collection of data from multiple touchpoints continues to increase, so does data integration and governance.</li>
</ul>
</br>
</br>
Key areas where artificial intelligence and analytics can play a key role (driven by changes in consumer behavior):</br>
	<ul type = "disc">
	<li>New consumption patterns: As consumers increasingly shop online and digitally, the pandemic is dramatically changing the world Consumer habits. Buying technology products and services online, the growth of cloud services, and the demand for more devices in each household.</li>
	<li>Optimize the quality of customer service. With ordinary customers being overwhelmed by phone calls and inquiries, contact centers need to better plan personnel and resources. Manual processes based on experimental experience may lead to inaccurate capacity planning for acceleration and unprecedented demand.</li>
	<li>The last kilometer. Increasing trade barriers force companies to reconsider their supply chain strategies and overestimate the benefits of redundancy.</li>
</ul>
</br>		
For ICT companies to succeed in this new environment and take advantage of their competitive advantages, artificial intelligence and analytics are needed. As companies face and adapt to the new realities of the current crisis and its consequences, artificial intelligence capabilities will be extremely valuable.
